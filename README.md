# MSDS-451-Week4-TermProject-CheckpointA

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains all materials for **Week 4 â€“ Term Project Checkpoint A** of the *MSDS 451: Programming for Data Science* course.  
The project focuses on designing an **actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF)** targeting large-cap technology companies â€” **Apple (AAPL)**, **Microsoft (MSFT)**, and **NVIDIA (NVDA)** â€” which are influenced by innovation cycles, monetary policy, and investor sentiment surrounding AI and cloud technologies.

The ETF is built around a **data-driven, rule-based framework** that combines traditional financial indicators with alternative data sources such as macroeconomic trends, sentiment, and public search interest.

## How to Run the Notebook

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MSDS451-Term-Project.git
cd MSDS451-Term-Project
```
### Install Dependencies

Use a Python 3.8+ environment and install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the Notebook
```
jupyter notebook notebooks/quick_eda.ipynb
```
The notebook will:

Download adjusted close prices for AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA (2019â€“2024)

Compute daily returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios

Generate plots and metrics saved under /week4_outputs/

### EDA Highlights
Metric	AAPL	MSFT	NVDA
Annualized Return	0.23	0.26	0.49
Annualized Volatility	0.21	0.22	0.36
Sharpe Ratio	1.00	1.09	1.31

- NVDA demonstrates the highest return and Sharpe ratio, reflecting its strong performance during the AI-driven cycle.
- Correlations between daily returns (â‰ˆ0.65â€“0.85) indicate shared macro-tech exposure with limited but present diversification.
- Volatility analysis reveals identifiable risk regimes, notably during COVID-19 and 2022â€“2023 rate cycles.

### Key Outputs
